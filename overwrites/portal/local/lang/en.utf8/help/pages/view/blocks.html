<h3>Edit Page</h3>
<p>Designing your page layout enables you to personalize the way in which your resources and information can be displayed. For example, if you wish to display only one of your Blog entries, click on the Blogs tab, then drag the Blog Entry block into your page area. Remember to click Save as you add new elements to your page.</p>
<p>As you build up the content of your layout you can check on how it will look by clicking on 'Display my page'. Click on 'Back to create my page' to continue editing.</p>
