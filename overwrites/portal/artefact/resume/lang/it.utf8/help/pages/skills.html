<h3>My Skills</h3>
<p>The skills area is divided into three sections: Personal, Academic and Work. Using the HTML editor within each box, you can create goal description artefacts. These may be added to your views.</p>
<p>Employers are always interested in what skills you can bring to a role. You can also use this section to display what attributes would bring to a collaborative community or working group.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to save each new entry using the button at the foot of the page.</p>
