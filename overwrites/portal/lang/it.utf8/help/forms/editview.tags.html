<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>You can add tags to views you create. Tags allow you add descriptive labels to views, which you can use to classify and search for them.</p>
<p>To associate multiple tags to a view, separate each tag with a comma. For example – ‘Assessment, Semester 2, Management’.</p>
<p>Clicking on <strong>Show my tags</strong> will generate a list of those tags you have previously used within your portfolio and the number of times they have been entered. Clicking on a tag in this list will add it to the tags for this view, or remove it if you have already tagged the view with this tag.</p>
