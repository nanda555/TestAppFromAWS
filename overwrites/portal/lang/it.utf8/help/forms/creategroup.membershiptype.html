<h3>Membership Mode</h3>
<p>When you create a new group you can choose from a number of membership options which determine how other users may join your group.</p>
<h4>Anyone Can Join</h4>
<p>
  Setting your group membership to Anyone Can Join mode will allow any user of the site to become a member simply by visiting your group page and  clicking the join button.</p>
<h4>Request to Join</h4>
<p>
  Setting your group membership mode to Request to Join means that any user  can request to join your group, however as owner you can choose to accept or decline this request. The requesting member will be automatically notified of your decision.</p>
<h4>Invite Only</h4>
<p>
  Setting your group membership mode to Invite Only means that only users that you have sent an invite to may join your group.
<h4>Controlled Membership </h4>
<p>
  Controlled Membership is only available to Site Administrators and allows administrators (and any staff associated with the group) to add and remove people from a group directly.</p>
<p>This is designed to be used for a course-based group where the membership is defined by an external system (such as an institution's enrolment system) and the staff user wishes to replicate that membership in the group.</p>
