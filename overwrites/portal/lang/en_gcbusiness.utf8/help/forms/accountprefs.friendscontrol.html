<h3>Colleagues Control</h3>
<p>Choose whether other users may add you to their colleagues list. If you are added to a colleagues list, the owner of that list is added to your list. When you remove someone from your colleagues list you are also removed from their list. Choose either:</p>
<p><strong>Nobody may add me as a colleague:</strong> no one may add you to their list.</p>
<p><strong>New colleagues require my authorization:</strong> your authorization is needed for you to be added to a list. If you approve, they will be added to your list.</p>
<p><strong>New colleagues are automatically authorized:</strong> anyone may add you to their list.</p>
