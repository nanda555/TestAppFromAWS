<h3>Find Colleagues</h3>
<p>This page lets you search for users to add as colleagues. Depending on their colleague control settings you may be automatically accepted as their colleague or you may need to send a colleague request. Some users may not allow colleague requests at all.</p>
<p>When sending a colleague request you can choose to include a short message introducing yourself. This is especially important if you have a Display Name set, as others will not see your real name.</p>
