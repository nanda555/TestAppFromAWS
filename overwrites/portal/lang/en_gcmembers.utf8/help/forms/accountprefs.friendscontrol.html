<h3>Members Control</h3>
<p>Choose whether other users may add you to their members list. If you are added to a members list, the owner of that list is added to your list. When you remove someone from your members list you are also removed from their list. Choose either:</p>
<p><strong>Nobody may add me as a member:</strong> no one may add you to their list.</p>
<p><strong>New members require my authorization:</strong> your authorization is needed for you to be added to a list. If you approve, they will be added to your list.</p>
<p><strong>New members are automatically authorized:</strong> anyone may add you to their list.</p>
