<h3>Find Members</h3>
<p>This page lets you search for users to add as members. Depending on their member control settings you may be automatically accepted as their member or you may need to send a member request. Some users may not allow member requests at all.</p>
<p>When sending a member request you can choose to include a short message introducing yourself. This is especially important if you have a Display Name set, as others will not see your real name.</p>
